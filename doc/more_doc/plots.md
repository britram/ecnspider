# All the plots we need
* For every plot, we have an IPv4 and IPv6 version
* Have plots for "Everything OK" which will just show bars at max. height.
* Make the plot we have for one vantage point

* Visualize the ranks of errors and the ranks of disagreements.
* "Empirical cumulative distribution function"

* Look for domains where for at least one vantage point both connects work, and for at least one other vantage point just one connect works (error and disagreement)
* From at least one vantage point both connects work, and for at least one other vantage point neither connect works (connectivity disagreement)
* For all except one vantage point both work, and for the last vantage point just ECN off connect works. (error)
* For all except one vantage point both work, and for the last vantage point just ECN on connect works. (special)

* For domains that have an error at least once, make an error count across vantage points (and no-connectivity count)

* For the top thousand websites, the problem can be solved with a few phone calls.
